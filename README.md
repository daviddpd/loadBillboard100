# loadBillboard100
Script to load json files of Billboard Top 100 into a MySQL/MariaDB

## JSON Files
The JSON files used in this project are sourced from [mhollingshead/billboard-hot-100](https://github.com/mhollingshead/billboard-hot-100), which contains weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart data from 1958 to present.

## Created by AI

This has been almost entirely created by [cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) using AI, claude-3.5-sonnet, on the free tier. Also include my initial chat to the AI as chat.txt.  This was done and sucessful in a single shot (except I guess I forgot my internal db didn't have SSL setup, so I backed that requirement off.)

## Educational and Career Skill Development Project

Well, I was feeeling some nostalgia, and thinking about music, or "Cominog of Age" music.  At least
in my mind, coming of age is usually high school, so I want to curate a list of my favorites songs 
from between 1992 and 1996.  (Class of '96 ... GenXer here).  And being unemployed at this (bad)
time, need some silly projects to up my skill level and jump on the AI bandwagon.   

This was actually my second.  The first was an iOS app that I planned to commit to github soon.
